# Human-Action-Recognition-Sensor-Dataset
We compiled multiple human activity recognition (HAR) datasets, each collected using IMU sensors. These datasets cover four activity states: sitting, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and standing. Further details can be found in the paper Time Series Adaptation Network for Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition.
